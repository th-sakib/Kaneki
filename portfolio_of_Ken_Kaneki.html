			<h2>Personality</h2>
			<p class="para">To be honest I'm a shy boy. I usually spends most of my time reading books, mostly novels. I'm extremely gentle and appears to be optimistic most of the time. Influenced by my mother and a true testament of modesty, I willingly takes blame and punishment from others so that I can be someone who doesn't hurt people. But after a incedent I turn into a ghoul(A blood sucking vampire)</p>
